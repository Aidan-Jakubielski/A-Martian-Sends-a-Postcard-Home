            <h2>Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings</h2>
            <p>and some are treasured for their markings –</p>
            <br>
            <p>they cause the eyes to melt</p>
            <p>or the body to shriek without pain.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have never seen one fly, but</p>
            <p>sometimes they perch on the hand.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Mist is when the sky is tired of flight</p>
            <p>and rests its soft machine on ground:</p>
            <br>
            <p>then the world is dim and bookish</p>
            <p>like engravings under tissue paper.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Rain is when the earth is television.</p>
            <p>It has the property of making colours darker.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Model T is a room with the lock inside –</p>
            <p>a key is turned to free the world</p>
            <br>
            <p>for movement, so quick there is a film</p>
            <p>to watch for anything missed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But time is tied to the wrist</p>
            <p>or kept in a box, ticking with impatience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps,</p>
            <p>that snores when you pick it up.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If the ghost cries, they carry it</p>
            <p>to their lips and soothe it to sleep</p>
            <br>
            <p>with sounds. And yet, they wake it up</p>
            <p>deliberately, by tickling with a finger.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Only the young are allowed to suffer</p>
            <p>openly. Adults go to a punishment room</p>
            <br>
            <p>with water but nothing to eat.</p>
            <p>They lock the door and suffer the noises</p>
            <br>
            <p>alone. No one is exempt</p>
            <p>and everyone’s pain has a different smell.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At night, when all the colours die,</p>
            <p>they hide in pairs</p>
            <br>
            <p>and read about themselves –</p>
            <p>in colour, with their eyelids shut.</p>

                <h2>&#8226 Tone</h2>
                <p class="ml-4 pl-4">The tone of this poem is confused but also analytical. The poem is in the perspective of a martian who is describing different items that are on Earth, but they do not understand what these items are. This can be seen through “Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings and some are treasured for their markings –” which describes books and how they are “treasured” for the words and pages. Another example of this is in line 13: “Model T is a room with the lock inside – a key is turned to free the world”. This line describes cars and when they are turned on they allow people to roam the world and go wherever they would like.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>&#8226 Voice and Character</h2>
                <p class="ml-4 pl-4">The voice and character of “A Martian Sends a Postcard Home” can be seen as first person through the eyes of a Martian. This Martian traveled to Earth but he does not understand any material items. The poem itself is a postcard that is written by the Martian which he plans to send back to his home planet. Craig Raine utilizes imagery and metaphors in order to portray the viewpoint from the eyes of the Martian who is very confused about the planet he has traveled to.</p>
